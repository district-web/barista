				HealthKit Data
			  </h1>
			  If you choose to have Barista integrate with HealthKit then the
			  application will have access only to the health data types you opt-in
			  to access. Barista requests permission to write certain data types
			  into your HealthKit data store. The data read from HealthKit is used
			  solely within the app. It is not collected or disclosed outside of
			  your local installation of the the app. Only those data types relevant
			  to the app are accessed. The data read is used to update and saved to
			  the HealthKit store. In no case is your personal data ever transfered
			  to a 3rd party. It is only ever kept within the application container
			  of Barista or transfered to your personal HealthKit data store as per
			  your permission choices.
