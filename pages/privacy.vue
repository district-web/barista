          not be modified or assigned by you, but may be assigned by us without
          restriction. In the event that any provision is found to be
          unenforceable or invalid, that provision will still be applied to the
          fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and such determination
          will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining
          remaining provisions of these Terms. Our failure to exercise or
          enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not create a
          waiver of that right or provision. Headings used in these terms are
